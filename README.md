# Statistical Methods for Language Processing
This repository contains the Final Project for the course "Statistical Methods for Language processing", part of the Multilingual Technologies Master's program at the FH Campus Vienna.
It applies statistical and computational methods to the analysis of a literary text from the Project Gutenberg library. Using RStudio and tools like gutenbergr and tidytext, the project explores basic techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including bigram analysis, chi-square testing, entropy measurements, and text xlassification with a Naive Bayes classifier. With that linguisitc patterns are uncovered.
